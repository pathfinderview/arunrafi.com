  <h1>Law of reversed effort</h1>
  <p><time datetime="2025-07-12">12 Jul 2025</time></p>

  <p>Grip a goal too tightly and it slips out of reach. The harder the push, the harder the pushback.</p>

  <p>I once spent weeks scripting every line of a presentation, in college. The first live run stumbled, the script fell aside, and conversation with the audience carried the rest. Applause grew only after the weight of perfection lifted.</p>

  <p>Games say the same thing. Level one looks impossible. Fail, respawn, repeat, and patterns surface. Hands relax, movements sync, and flow appears. The run that clears the stage feels almost effortless.</p>

  <p>Flow hates strain. Overthinking shifts attention from the task to the tension itself. Loosen the grip, let actions link without commentary, and the work moves on its own.</p>

  <p>Less heaviness, more tries.</p>
