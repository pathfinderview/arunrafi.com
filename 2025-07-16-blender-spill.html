  <h1>The Blender Spill</h1>
  <p><time datetime="2025-07-16">16 Jul 2025</time></p>

  <p>Two actresses face the same task: sell a blender at a mall kiosk. The first nails her pitch, locks the lid, and pours a perfect strawberry–banana smoothie.</p>

  <p>The second repeats the script but misses the latch. Pink liquid arcs over the counter and her apron. Shoppers laugh, hand her napkins, and—illogically—buy more blenders from her than from the flawless demo.</p>

  <p>Psychologist Richard Wiseman staged this scene. It revives Elliot Aronson’s 1966 “pratfall effect”: a minor slip boosts the charm of someone already proven competent. Aronson’s coffee-spilling star gained affection; an average performer did not. Skill first, stumble second.</p>

  <p> Perfection can feel rehearsed; a blemish feels real. A quick assist sparks a wish to repay the debt. Replicas mirror the effect in everyday choices: a minor slip boosts trust—once skill is clear.</p>
