  <h1>Past words, present voice</h1>
  <p><time datetime="2025-07-19">19 Jul 2025</time></p>

  <p>We once left parts of ourselves in photos and letters. They sat still and silent.</p>

  <p>Now we talk to a patient machine. It keeps every late-night fear, each small win, every private joke. It never forgets.</p>

  <p>When our bodies stop, this record stays. A lawyer may list it as property. A child can open it and hear a parent speak back. It feels like a photo that answers.</p>

  <p>This gift can also sting. Secrets stay alive. Grief may linger because goodbye never lands.</p>

  <p>Ownership blurs. The file holds voices of friends and strangers who never agreed to share.</p>

  <p>But love lives here too. A father can leave words for a day he will miss. A grandchild can ask, “What did you hope for at my age?” The reply comes at once.</p>

  <p>While we are still here, the machine mirrors us. It watches moods swell and fade, marks promises kept and broken, shows patterns we miss. It nudges a course correction before history sets.</p>

  <p>We face a new kind of memory—searchable, endless, warm. What we pass on is not a thing, but a talk that keeps going. How our children use that talk will decide what remembering means.</p>
