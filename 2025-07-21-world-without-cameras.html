        <h1>World without cameras</h1>
        <p><time datetime="2025-07-21">21 Jul 2025</time></p>
        <p>A quiet revolution is underway. AI-driven images and videos are turning lavish photoshoots into clicks on a screen. Traditional media agencies, along with roles like location scouts, set designers, stylists, and production managers, built on complex logistics and high costs, may soon lose their purpose.</p>
        <p>Models and studios could fade into irrelevance as flawless visuals become instantly achievable. AI even simulates authenticity: a gentle shake, subtle imperfections, genuine smiles—blurring our sense of what's real.</p>
        <p>Influencers won't vanish due to lost authenticity but from oversaturation. When every image captivates equally, influence itself becomes scarce.</p>
        <p>Professional cameras, expensive dresses, elaborate makeup, and physical accessories might all turn obsolete. Capturing reality gives way to crafting ideal experiences, personalized instantly by algorithms. Shared moments could fragment into isolated digital realities, each customized to individual tastes.</p>
        <p>As reality becomes endlessly recreatable, fleeting moments lose value. Beauty evolves from universal ideals to personalized, shifting standards, potentially reducing the desire for physical fashion and cosmetics as digital identities gain prominence.</p>
        <p>This isn't just technology reshaping industries—it's redefining how we perceive, desire, and remember.</p>
