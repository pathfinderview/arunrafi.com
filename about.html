  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>I chase ideas the way some people chase sunsets; never quite catching them, always loving the colour along the way.</p>

  <p>A few of the things I’ve built stuck; many fizzled. That gap keeps me curious. Influenced by the crisp prose of David Perell and Steph Ango, I draft each night, teaching myself to think by writing.</p>

  <p>Books fuel the habit. <em>Zorba the Greek</em> reminds me that life is a tug-of-war between the thinker and the doer. I used to sketch daily; now the pencils come out once a month for a quick superhero portrait requested at bedtime by my son. The muscle still twitches.</p>

  <p>I’m a quiet introvert who once ran a social-experience startup, a little like Airbnb but for meeting new people. When it closed, I felt a strange relief, proof that curiosity can outrun comfort.</p>

  <p>I haven’t decided if dawn or midnight suits me better. Both feel like fresh starts.</p>
